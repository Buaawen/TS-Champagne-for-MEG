TS-Champagne is a method for MEG source imaging that enhances the accuracy of source extent estimation. It utilizes the characteristics of the Champagne algorithm. The result of the first stageÂ 
Champagne algorithm imaging is used as a priori information, which improves the accuracy of the second stage estimation of the source extent.

Implementation code and example data for the TS-Champagne method are provided here.
